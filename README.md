# Imaging Toolkit

Scripts:
- merge_segementation: can combine binary segmentations (type nifti) together using a reference volume to produce a single nifti binary
- DWI scan separator: can convert any multi-volume nifti files (not exclusively DWIs - just prominent in the clinical space) to separate nifti files
